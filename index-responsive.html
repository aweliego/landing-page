            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>Want to organise an event, but not all your guests have Facebook or Whatsapp? You've come to the right place. This platform doesn't require 
                any of your guests to be on social media or to share their numbers with you. All they need is an email address. Let you and your guests be walked through the steps 
                of creating or joining an event, and smile at how painless it is to get it done in just a few clicks, without sacrificing the layout.
